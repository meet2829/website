                <h2>An Exiled Prince Searching for the Truth</h2>
                <p>A curious squire desperate to prove himself. <br>
                An epic romance that will change the world.</p>
                <p>
                    Sixteen-year-old Prince Anden has no memory of the night his father died. People say he caused the accident;
                    his brother, the king, has never forgiven him. Now, years later and exiled in disgrace, Anden receives a mysterious note.
                </p>
                <p class="italic-text">
                    "You didn't slip. You were pushed. Your father didn't drown. He was murdered."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anden falls for mischievous palace squire River, but the timing couldnâ€™t be worse. He returns home to find
                    his kingdom threatened by enemy states, his brother about to come of age, and their uncle, the Lord Regent, 
                    making moves to usurp the throne. Anden must uncover a decades-old conspiracy before it destroys his kingdom,
                    his family, and the boy he loves.
